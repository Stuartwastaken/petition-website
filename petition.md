# Petition to Reinstate the Christopher Columbus Statue and Celebrate Indigenous People

We, the undersigned, call on the City of St. Louis to reinstate the statue of Christopher Columbus at Tower Grove Park and establish a dedicated space to celebrate Indigenous people and their history. We believe that public spaces should recognize the complexity of history and promote an inclusive understanding of diverse perspectives.
